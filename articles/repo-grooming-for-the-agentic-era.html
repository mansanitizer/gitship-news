<strong>Your codebase has a new reader. It doesn't skim.</strong>

<p>For two decades, technical debt was a human problem. You could navigate a 500-line function with enough coffee and context. You could infer intent from cryptic variable names. You could hold the entire module in your head if you squinted hard enough.</p>

<p>That era is over.</p>

<p>AI agents are now parsing your repositories. They don't infer. They don't squint. They read literally, token by token, and they scale your mistakes at machine speed. Technical debt that used to slow down your onboarding now actively misleads your automation.</p>

<h2>The Context Window Tax</h2>

<p>Let's talk economics. Every agent interaction burns tokens. A 500-line function isn't just hard to read—it's expensive to process. When an agent needs to understand a module, it pulls context. Bloated, monolithic code wastes that context on noise instead of signal.</p>

<strong>The math is brutal:</strong> If your average function is 200 lines and 40% is dead code or redundant logic, you're burning 80 tokens per function call that could have been spent on actual reasoning. Multiply that across hundreds of agent interactions per day. Your context window budget evaporates on technical debt overhead.

<p>Modular code isn't just cleaner—it's agent-efficient. Small, single-responsibility functions mean agents spend tokens on logic, not archaeology.</p>

<h2>Pattern Replication at Machine Speed</h2>

<p>Here's where it gets dangerous. Agents learn from your repository. They pattern-match. They replicate.</p>

<p>If your codebase has inconsistent naming conventions, agents will propagate that inconsistency. If you mix error handling patterns—some functions throw, some return Result types, some use callbacks—agents will generate code that does all three, randomly. If your tests are sparse or flaky, agents will write sparse or flaky tests.</p>

<strong>Inconsistency breeds inconsistency at machine speed.</strong> What used to take a team months to corrupt now takes an agent-based refactoring sprint a single afternoon.

<p>This isn't hypothetical. Teams running agent-assisted development report that code quality diverges rapidly without strict guardrails. The agents aren't buggy—they're mirrors. They reflect your repo's true state, warts and all, and then amplify it.</p>

<h2>Semantic Confusion: When Agents Take You Literally</h2>

<p>Humans navigate ambiguity. We read between the lines. If a function is called <code>processData</code> but actually validates, transforms, and caches, we figure it out from context.</p>

<p>Agents don't.</p>

<p>A function named <code>processData</code> tells an agent that it processes data. When the agent uses it for validation-only tasks, bugs emerge. When the agent generates new code that assumes <code>processData</code> only processes (not validates), the system breaks.</p>

<strong>Semantic debt</strong>—the gap between what code is named and what it does—is now a blocking error. Agents act on names. They trust documentation. They assume your types are accurate. When any of these are wrong, agents generate confidently incorrect code.

<p>This is why type coverage matters more than ever. A typed codebase isn't just safer for humans—it's navigable for agents. TypeScript, Rust, Go with strict modes: these aren't preferences anymore. They're agent interface contracts.</p>

<h2>The Grooming Checklist</h2>

<p>So what do you actually do? Here's the tactical list:</p>

<h3>1. Naming Audit</h3>
<p>Run a pass on public functions and classes. Does the name match the behavior? If a function does three things, split it into three functions. Agents need literal truth in naming.</p>

<h3>2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)</h3>
<p>Document why major decisions were made. Agents can't read your team's Slack history from 2023. ADRs provide the context that agents need to make consistent decisions going forward.</p>

<h3>3. Type Coverage</h3>
<p>Aim for 90%+ type coverage on public APIs. Untyped code is a black box to agents. They'll guess, and they'll guess wrong.</p>

<h3>4. Test Hygiene</h3>
<p>Tests are training data. If your tests are comprehensive and clear, agents learn correct patterns. If your tests are sparse or confusing, agents learn to write sparse or confusing code. Treat test quality as agent training quality.</p>

<h3>5. Dead Code Purge</h3>
<p>Remove unused functions, commented-out blocks, and deprecated patterns. Agents can't distinguish between "this is legacy but still works" and "this is the recommended approach." If it's in the repo, it's fair game.</p>

<h3>6. Consistency Enforcement</h3>
<p>Pick patterns and stick to them. Error handling, logging, async patterns—document the standard and enforce it. Consistency isn't boring anymore. It's agent fuel.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The repositories that thrive in the agentic era won't be the most sophisticated. They'll be the most legible.</p>

<p>Clean code was always a virtue. Now it's a multiplier. Every hour you spend on repo grooming pays dividends every time an agent reads your code. Every inconsistency you fix prevents dozens of agent-generated bugs. Every well-named function saves tokens and prevents confusion.</p>

<p>This isn't about making code pretty. It's about making it machine-readable. Your codebase is no longer just for your team. It's for your agents too.</p>

<p>Treat it accordingly.</p>
