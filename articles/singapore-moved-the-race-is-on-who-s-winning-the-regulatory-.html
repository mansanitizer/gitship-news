<strong>The infrastructure of tomorrow's financial system is being built today—and regulators are racing to claim it.</strong>

<p>Singapore moved first. On January 22, 2026, the city-state unveiled the world's first comprehensive governance framework for agentic AI at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Model AI Governance Framework for Agentic AI (MGFA)—developed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) alongside the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) AI Risk Management Guidelines—established clear guardrails for autonomous financial agents that can reason, decide, and execute transactions on behalf of users.</p>

<p>The message was unmistakable: Singapore intends to be the global headquarters for agentic finance.</p>

<h2>The Chasers Are Scrambling</h2>

<p>The European Union isn't sitting idle. The EU AI Act, which entered into force in August 2024, classifies AI systems used for credit scoring and creditworthiness assessment as high-risk, imposing strict compliance obligations. In November 2025, the European Banking Authority published detailed guidance mapping AI Act requirements onto banking operations. But the EU's approach remains fragmented—financial services rules overlap with general AI regulations, creating a compliance labyrinth that lacks the surgical precision of Singapore's framework.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is taking a different tack. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced in January 2026 that it will <em>not</em> introduce AI-specific regulation, instead relying on existing principles-based frameworks like the Consumer Duty. "Our regulatory approach is principles-based and focused on outcomes," the FCA stated. "We want to give firms flexibility to adapt to technological change." It's a gamble—flexibility versus clarity—and one that may leave UK fintechs guessing while Singapore offers certainty.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates is emerging as a dark horse. Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and its Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) have been embedding AI across regulatory frameworks, releasing guidance on AI applications in SupTech and RegTech. At Abu Dhabi Finance Week 2025, FSRA announced key enhancements to its digital assets framework, signaling ambitions to capture Middle Eastern fintech flows.</p>

<h2>The Laggard: United States</h2>

<p>Then there's the United States—fragmented, slow, and playing catch-up. The Treasury Department's December 2024 report on AI in financial services recommended "financial services-specific AI information sharing" but stopped short of unified regulation. The SEC, CFTC, and banking agencies continue to operate in silos, with no comprehensive federal framework for agentic AI in finance. While regulators issued a joint proposal for digital asset harmonization in 2025, agentic AI remains an afterthought.</p>

<p>As Resaro Co-CEO April Chin noted about Singapore's framework: "As the first authoritative resource addressing the specific risks of agentic AI, the MGF fills a critical gap in policy guidance."</p>

<p>That gap remains wide open in Washington.</p>

<h2>Where to Build</h2>

<p>For fintech founders choosing jurisdictions, the calculus is shifting. Singapore offers regulatory clarity, government support, and a tested sandbox. The EU offers market scale but compliance complexity. The UK offers flexibility but uncertainty. The UAE offers ambition but limited market depth.</p>

<p>And the US? It offers the world's largest capital markets—and a regulatory vacuum that grows more expensive by the day.</p>

<strong>Singapore moved. The race is on.</strong>
