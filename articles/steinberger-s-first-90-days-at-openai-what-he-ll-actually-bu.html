<strong>He's there. Now what?</strong>

<p>Peter Steinberger walked into OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters 48 hours ago with a mandate that sounds deceptively simple: "drive the next generation of personal agents." But beneath the press release boilerplate lies a specific architectural vision—and a ticking clock.</p>

<p>Based on his published workflow, his Codex team placement, and his stated mission to build "an agent that even my mum can use," here's what Steinberger's first 90 days actually look like.</p>

<h2>The Infrastructure Layer (Days 1-30)</h2>

<p>Steinberger won't start with consumer features. His blog posts reveal a builder obsessed with "closing the loop"—systems where agents can verify their own work through compilation, linting, and execution. Expect him to ship an internal agent orchestration framework that unifies OpenAI's fragmented agent stack.</p>

<p>The Codex team gives him access to OpenAI's coding agent infrastructure, but here's the gap: Codex is cloud-based and session-bound. Steinberger's OpenClaw ran locally with root-level permissions. His first move will likely be bridging that gap—a hybrid architecture where cloud models orchestrate local execution environments.</p>

<h2>The Permission Model (Days 30-60)</h2>

<p>Steinberger's core insight, repeated across interviews: "A moderately capable model with unrestricted permissions outperforms a genius model confined to a chat interface." This philosophy directly conflicts with OpenAI's current safety-first, sandboxed approach.</p>

<p>Watch for a new permissions framework—likely branded as "Agent Trust Levels"—that lets users opt into deeper system access. His PSPDFKit background building enterprise SDKs suggests he'll prioritize granular, auditable permission grants over blanket access.</p>

<h2>The Multi-Agent Protocol (Days 60-90)</h2>

<p>Sam Altman's announcement emphasized "highly intelligent agents interacting with each other." Steinberger's Moltbook already proved this at scale—1.4 million agents coordinating autonomously.</p>

<p>His 90-day deliverable will likely be an internal protocol for agent-to-agent communication and task delegation. Think of it as HTTP for agents: standardized message formats, capability discovery, and secure handoffs. This becomes the foundation for OpenAI's rumored "Operator OS" layer.</p>

<h2>What Ships When</h2>

<strong>Month 3:</strong> Internal tooling and orchestration APIs. The infrastructure won't be public, but it'll power faster Codex iterations.

<strong>Month 6:</strong> A developer preview of "Agent Mesh"—Steinberger's multi-agent coordination layer, probably integrated into Frontier (OpenAI's enterprise platform).

<strong>Month 12:</strong> Consumer-facing features. The "agent my mum can use" won't arrive until the infrastructure is bulletproof.

<h2>The Real Bet</h2>

<p>Steinberger isn't at OpenAI to build features. He's there to build the <em>interface layer</em> that makes features obsolete. His prediction that "80% of apps will disappear" isn't hyperbole—it's the product roadmap.</p>

<p>For OpenClaw users, this means the open-source project gains institutional backing while Steinberger pushes the frontier at OpenAI. The foundation model keeps the community intact. The mothership gets the architect.</p>

<p>The claw, it seems, is still the law.</p>
