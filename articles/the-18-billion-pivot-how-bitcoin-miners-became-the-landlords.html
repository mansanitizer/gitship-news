<strong>The infrastructure is real. The hash rate was just the opening act.</strong>

<p>Here's the number that changes everything: <strong>$8.7 billion</strong>. That's what Core Scientific locked in with CoreWeave for 500 megawatts of AI infrastructure over 12 years. Add TeraWulf's $9.5 billion, 25-year joint venture with Fluidstack—backed by a $1.3 billion Google guarantee—and you're looking at nearly $20 billion in contracted revenue from companies that, two years ago, were dismissed as "crypto miners."</p>

<p>Your power contract is now worth more than your ASIC fleet.</p>

<h2>The Players</h2>

<strong>Core Scientific</strong> emerged from bankruptcy to become the blueprint. Their CoreWeave deal—$8.7 billion over 12 years for 500 MW—represents the largest single AI infrastructure contract signed by any former Bitcoin miner. The math is brutal and beautiful: that's roughly $17.4 million per megawatt over the contract life, compared to Bitcoin mining's volatile $2-5 million per MW annually depending on hashprice.

<strong>TeraWulf</strong> is executing at scale. In 10 months, they contracted 510 MW of critical IT load. Their October 2025 Fluidstack joint venture in Abernathy, Texas adds 168 MW with a $9.5 billion revenue commitment over 25 years. Google backstopped $1.3 billion of the lease obligations, effectively converting TeraWulf's project debt into Big Tech credit risk.

<strong>CleanSpark</strong> is building the pipeline. After hiring Jeffrey Thomas—who built Saudi Arabia's multi-billion-dollar Humain AI program—the company locked up 890+ MW in the Houston area, approaching the psychologically significant 1 gigawatt threshold. No mega-lease announced yet, but the land and power are secured. The infrastructure is real.

<h2>The Arbitrage</h2>

<p>Why are they winning? Because while VCs threw billions at AI startups, the Bitcoin miners quietly built the actual rails.</p>

<p>The average data center takes 5-7 years to permit and energize. CleanSpark scaled a 100 MW facility in six months. Core Scientific had 1.2 GW of contracted power sitting there, waiting. TeraWulf's Lake Mariner site offers 89% zero-carbon energy—a requirement for ESG-conscious hyperscalers that legacy data centers struggle to match.</p>

<p>The "Google Backstop" changed the game. When TeraWulf signs with Fluidstack, Google guarantees the lease payments. This transforms miner credit risk into investment-grade paper, unlocking project financing at 85% loan-to-cost ratios from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The miners aren't just renting space anymore—they're operating a credit-enhanced infrastructure platform.</p>

<h2>The Implication</h2>

<p>Compute scarcity just became power scarcity. NVIDIA Blackwell is sold out through mid-2026. The bottleneck isn't GPUs—it's megawatts.</p>

<p>Bitcoin miners spent a decade learning to hunt stranded power: flared gas in North Dakota, hydro in Upstate New York, wind in West Texas. That expertise now feeds the AI beast. As Meltem Demirors of Crucible Capital put it: "They have the powered shell, they're ripping out the [mining machines], and their tenant is bringing the GPUs."</p>

<p>The sector raised over $43 billion in AI and HPC contracts in 18 months, per CoinShares. Cipher Mining's $5.5 billion AWS lease. Hut 8's $7 billion Fluidstack deal. The CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF soared 160% in 2025—not because Bitcoin pumped, but because the market finally understood: these aren't crypto companies anymore. They're power arbitrageurs with data center expertise.</p>

<h2>The Kicker</h2>

<p>The halving didn't kill Bitcoin mining. It revealed what the infrastructure was actually worth.</p>

<p>When the block reward dropped to 3.125 BTC in April 2024, hashprice cratered. Marginal miners died. The survivors looked at their power contracts—0.08/kWh in Texas, hydro rates in NYISO Zone A—and realized they were sitting on the scarcest asset in AI: energized, permitted, transmission-connected land.</p>

<p>Core Scientific's stock tripled. TeraWulf jumped 134% year-to-date. The market is pricing these companies not on their Bitcoin holdings, but on their megawatt pipelines.</p>

<p>The hash was just the proof of work. The power was always the point.</p>
