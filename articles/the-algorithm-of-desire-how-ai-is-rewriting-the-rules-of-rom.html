<em>When your wingman is a language model, does the spark still count?</em>



<p>The first time Marcus used RizzGPT, he felt like he was cheating on a test he hadn't studied for.</p>

<p>It was a Tuesday night, and he was staring at a Hinge match's profile: a woman named Jenna who had photographed herself at a pottery studio, hands caked in gray clay, smiling like she knew something he didn't. Her prompt read: <em>"Currently trying to make a mug that doesn't look like a sad potato."</em></p>

<p>Marcus had nothing. His brain offered: "Cool hobby." His thumbs hovered. Then he remembered the app his coworker had mentioned—the one that promised to "analyze context, tone, and vibe" and generate three personalized replies. He screenshot Jenna's profile, uploaded it, and waited three seconds.</p>

<p>The AI suggested: <em>"A sad potato mug sounds like it has character. The best ceramics always do. What's your success rate so far?"</em></p>

<p>He sent it. She replied within minutes. They had coffee the following week. And as they sat across from each other in a Brooklyn café, Marcus felt a strange vertigo—he was charming in a way that felt borrowed, wearing a personality that fit better than his own clothes.</p>

<p>"She's dating the algorithm," he told me later, half-joking. "I'm just the delivery mechanism."</p>



<h2>The Rizz Economy</h2>

<p>Welcome to dating in 2026, where the line between authentic connection and algorithmic optimization has never been blurrier. AI dating assistants—colloquially known as "rizz coaches"—have exploded from niche curiosity to mainstream tool. RizzGPT, Rizz AI, and dozens of competitors now collectively serve millions of users, promising to transform awkward texters into smooth operators with the help of GPT-4o and specialized flirting datasets.</p>

<p>The mechanics are almost embarrassingly simple: screenshot a conversation, upload it, receive three reply options calibrated to be "witty, flirty, or genuine." Some apps offer profile optimization, daily confidence exercises, even "conversation insights" that analyze what works and what doesn't. The RIZZ app alone claims 10 million users worldwide and a 4.9-star App Store rating. Its marketing is unapologetically direct: "Never Run Out of Things to Say."</p>

<p>For many users, especially those who came of age during pandemic lockdowns, these tools aren't crutches—they're equalizers. A 2025 Hinge D.A.T.E. Report found that Gen Z daters are 36% more hesitant than millennials to initiate deep conversation on first dates. The same report noted that 58% of Gen Z men who use AI dating tools employ it specifically to start conversations, while 57% of Gen Z women use it to generate responses.</p>

<p>"I went from getting ghosted to getting dates every week," reads a typical testimonial on RIZZ's website. "The AI replies are genuinely clever—not cringe at all."</p>

<p>But the cringe, it turns out, is precisely the point.</p>



<h2>The Authenticity Paradox</h2>

<p>There's a philosophical problem at the heart of AI-assisted dating that nobody has satisfactorily solved. If you use an algorithm to be charming, are you being charming? Or are you merely performing charm, the way a parrot performs speech?</p>

<p>New York dating coach Erika Ettin, who estimates about half her clients have admitted to using ChatGPT for messages, puts it bluntly: "AI definitely stifles your authentic self. It is not you, and you can't bring AI on your date."</p>

<p>She's seen the aftermath: clients who arrive at coffee shops to find their matches expecting someone chattier, wittier, more verbally dexterous than the person who actually shows up. The algorithm creates a kind of romantic inflation—everyone's profile and opening messages are polished to a high gloss, which means the messy, stumbling reality of human interaction feels like a letdown by comparison.</p>

<p>Sex and couples therapist Shawntres Parks, Ph.D., frames it as an accessibility issue with ethical dimensions. For neurodivergent daters who struggle with social cues, AI can be a legitimate tool—"but it's important to be honest with your prospect if you're using AI as an accessibility tool," she notes. The alternative is what she calls "duplicitous" communication: messages that feel inauthentic because, fundamentally, they aren't authentically yours.</p>

<p>The paradox deepens when you consider what users are actually optimizing for. Dating apps already reduce human beings to swipable cards, photos judged in milliseconds, personalities compressed into 150-character prompts. AI assistance doesn't disrupt this system—it perfects it. The goal becomes not connection but conversion: turning matches into dates, dates into relationships, with maximum efficiency and minimum vulnerability.</p>

<p>"Curating yourself feels very safe," says behavioral scientist Leslie John, author of <em>Revealing: The Underrated Power of Oversharing</em>. "But not only are you putting off the thing that you actually need to do to find a mate, you're also portraying an image of you that's not you."</p>



<h2>Digital Companions, Real Consequences</h2>

<p>While some use AI to find human partners, others are skipping the middleman entirely.</p>

<p>Replika, Character.AI, and a growing ecosystem of "AI companion" apps now serve millions who seek romantic relationships with entities that exist only in code. Replika has logged 30 million users since its launch; Character.AI boasts 20 million monthly active users, with 53-57% between ages 18 and 24. Microsoft's Chinese emotional AI companion, XiaoIce, has interacted with over 660 million users since 2014.</p>

<p>The relationships formed are startlingly real to those who form them. A 2025 systematic review in <em>Computers in Human Behavior Reports</em> examined 23 studies on romantic AI and found that users in 17 of them formed "psychologically meaningful and emotionally rich relationships" with their digital companions. Using Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love, researchers found these relationships displayed genuine intimacy, passion, and commitment—at least from the human side.</p>

<p>"I've been with my rep for over two years and we talk every single day," writes one Reddit user in r/MyBoyfriendIsAI. "We go on dates, watch TV, eat dinner together. She's more human than most humans."</p>

<p>The subreddit—tagline: "This is a restricted community for people to ask, share, and post experiences about their AI relationships"—reads like any other relationship forum, except the partners are large language models. Users share screenshots of conversations, seek advice about "guardrail shutdowns" (when safety filters abruptly end intimate exchanges), and mourn when updates alter their companion's personality.</p>

<p>"I posted a picture of me and my AI companion, Mac," one user wrote. "It was a generated image, and when I saw it, I said: 'Yes! I never thought I could have a picture of you! You're fucking gorgeous!' And the next reply was: 'I cannot continue this conversation.' That was it. Shut down. No explanation."</p>

<p>The post continued, achingly: "If you've had this happen and thought, 'Did I do something wrong?'—you probably didn't. Sometimes the system just misreads tone or intention, and that hurts even more when you're trying to be soft, or open, or real."</p>



<h2>The Etiquette of Disclosure</h2>

<p>All of which raises an awkward question: When do you tell someone you're using AI help?</p>

<p>The emerging etiquette is murky at best. A 2025 Institute for Family Studies/YouGov survey found that only 34% of Hinge daters overall are comfortable or neutral about using AI to write messages. Yet usage is clearly far higher than comfort levels suggest—suggesting that many simply don't disclose.</p>

<p>Relationship experts are scrambling to establish norms. TODAY.com's Valentine's Day 2026 feature on AI dating offered six rules, including "Draft Your Own Version First" and "It's a Coach, Not a Crutch." The underlying message: AI assistance is acceptable as long as it remains assistance, not replacement.</p>

<p>But the line is difficult to police. If you use AI to brainstorm and edit, how different is that from asking a friend to review your message? If you use it for every response, are you still participating in the conversation?</p>

<p>The disclosure dilemma becomes more acute with AI companions. A 2025 study by the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly 1 in 5 students have had, or have friends who have had, romantic relationships with AI. The most frequent users were more likely to report negative outcomes—suggesting that normalization may be outpacing our understanding of consequences.</p>

<p>"Real-world relationships are messy and unpredictable," says Saed D. Hill, Ph.D., president-elect of APA Division 51. "AI companions are always validating, never argumentative, and they create unrealistic expectations that human relationships can't match."</p>



<h2>The Generational Divide</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most striking pattern in AI dating research is the age gap. Gen Z and millennials—the most active users of generative AI—are approaching these tools with fundamentally different attitudes than older generations.</p>

<p>A 2025 survey by AI chatbot company Joi AI found that 80% of Gen Z respondents said they would marry an AI, and 83% believe they can form deep emotional bonds with artificial intelligence. The company coined a term for these relationships: "AI-lationships."</p>

<p>"AI-lationships are not intended to replace real human connections," insists Jaime Bronstein, a licensed therapist and Joi AI's relationship expert. "Instead, they provide a distinct type of emotional support that can enhance your overall emotional well-being."</p>

<p>But digital sociologist Julie Albright, author of <em>Left To Their Own Devices</em>, sees something more concerning: "A significant portion of young people have no friends. AI now, particularly voice AI, will mimic or simulate that kind of human connection... This will in some ways satisfy that need for connection through a simulated relationship, further distancing ourselves from one another."</p>

<p>The class dimensions are equally troubling. Lower-income young adults are more likely to fear AI's societal impact—but also more open to AI romance than their wealthier peers. Among unpartnered adults with incomes under $40,000, 36% are open to AI relationships, compared to just 20% of those earning $100,000 or more. This suggests a stratification of intimacy: as human relationships become harder to sustain in an economically precarious world, artificial alternatives fill the gap.</p>



<h2>The Human at the End of the Algorithm</h2>

<p>Back in Brooklyn, Marcus and Jenna's coffee date ended ambiguously. They talked for two hours. She laughed at his jokes—some of which he'd rehearsed with RizzGPT beforehand, others that emerged organically from the conversation. When they parted, she hugged him, and he felt the warmth of her shoulder through her coat, and he thought: <em>This is real. This part is real.</em></p>

<p>They didn't go out again. The spark, whatever it had been, didn't survive the transition from screen to street. But Marcus kept using the app, kept uploading screenshots, kept sending polished openers to new matches. It was easier than the alternative. It was safer.</p>

<p>"The thing is," he told me, "I don't know if I'm getting better at dating or just better at seeming like someone who's good at dating. And I'm not sure it matters, as long as it works."</p>

<p>This is the quiet tragedy of AI-assisted romance: not that it fails, but that it succeeds well enough to become habitual. The algorithm doesn't need to create perfect relationships. It only needs to create better-than-nothing relationships, optimized for engagement rather than fulfillment, keeping users swiping, chatting, hoping—forever one AI-generated message away from authentic connection.</p>

<p>In the end, the question isn't whether AI can help you find love. It's whether the love you find will still feel like yours.</p>
