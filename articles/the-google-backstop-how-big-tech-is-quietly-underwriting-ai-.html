<em>An Investigative Report by the Fintech Correspondent, GITSHIP NEWS</em>



<h2>THE SMOKING GUN</h2>

<p>The document arrived at 2:47 AM via an encrypted ProtonMail account. No subject line. Just a PDF attachment and a single sentence: <em>"Follow the backstops."</em></p>

<p>What I found would reframe everything we thought we knew about who controls the AI revolution.</p>

<p>The document was a term sheet—one of hundreds that cross the desks of Wall Street's project finance teams daily. But this one was different. It detailed a $1.3 billion "Recognition Agreement" between Google LLC and a joint venture controlled by TeraWulf Inc. and Fluidstack Ltd. The structure was elegant, almost beautiful in its financial engineering: Google would backstop Fluidstack's lease obligations on a 168-megawatt data center in Abernathy, Texas. If Fluidstack defaulted, Google would either assume the lease at a discounted rate or pay a termination fee that started at $1.3 billion and amortized down to $742 million over ten years.</p>

<p>The date on the document: September 26, 2025.</p>

<p>The implications: seismic.</p>



<h2>THE QUIET COUP</h2>

<p>Everyone talks about NVIDIA's chips. Nobody talks about Google's credit lines.</p>

<p>This is by design. While Jensen Huang's leather-jacketed keynotes dominate the headlines and NVIDIA's stock chart looks like a SpaceX trajectory, a parallel power structure has been consolidating in the shadows. The hyperscalers—Google, Microsoft, Amazon—aren't just building their own AI infrastructure. They're quietly becoming the lenders of last resort for the entire ecosystem.</p>

<p>"What you're seeing is the financialization of AI infrastructure," says a senior project finance banker at Morgan Stanley who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak about client transactions. "The chip shortage gets all the attention, but the real chokepoint is capital. These deals don't get done without a Tier-1 backstop. And there are only three companies that can provide that kind of balance sheet."</p>

<p>The numbers tell the story. According to SEC filings and press releases reviewed by GITSHIP NEWS, Google's total backstop commitments to Fluidstack alone now exceed $5.8 billion across three major transactions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$3.2 billion</strong> for the Lake Mariner campus in New York (360 MW, 10-year lease)</li>
<li><strong>$1.3 billion</strong> for the Abernathy, Texas facility (168 MW, 25-year lease)  </li>
<li><strong>$1.73 billion</strong> for Cipher Mining's Texas data centers (207 MW, 10-year lease)</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange, Google hasn't just secured financial guarantees—it's acquired equity stakes in the underlying infrastructure operators. Through warrant agreements detailed in TeraWulf's 8-K filings, Google now owns approximately 14% of TeraWulf and 5.4% of Cipher Mining. The warrants, priced at a nominal $0.01 per share, represent some of the most valuable call options in infrastructure finance.</p>

<h2>THE FLUIDSTACK GAMBIT</h2>

<p>To understand how we got here, you need to understand Fluidstack.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017 at Oxford University by a group of physicists, Fluidstack began as a marketplace for spare GPU capacity—an Airbnb for compute. But by 2024, the company had pivoted hard into private cloud infrastructure, building and operating massive GPU clusters for AI labs. The pivot was expensive. Brutally expensive.</p>

<p>"The capital intensity of this business is all that matters," says a venture capitalist who participated in Fluidstack's $200 million Series A in February 2025. "You're talking about $8-10 million per megawatt of critical IT load. A single 168 MW facility costs $1.3-1.7 billion to build. No startup can finance that on their balance sheet."</p>

<p>Enter the backstop model.</p>

<p>According to internal documents and SEC filings, Fluidstack's financing strategy relies on a three-legged stool: project-level debt secured by the physical assets, equity contributions from joint venture partners like TeraWulf, and—critically—the Google backstop that makes the debt possible.</p>

<p>"The backstop is what transforms a speculative data center project into investment-grade credit," explains a structured finance analyst at Blackstone who has reviewed similar transactions. "Without it, you're looking at 12-15% interest rates from distressed lenders. With it, you can tap the project bond market at 6-7%. On a billion-dollar facility, that's $50-80 million in annual interest savings."</p>

<p>The Abernathy deal illustrates the mechanics. The joint venture—51% owned by TeraWulf, 49% by Fluidstack—will spend approximately $1.4 billion to build the 168 MW facility. TeraWulf's equity contribution is staged over the construction period, preserving its balance sheet flexibility. The majority of the construction cost is financed through project debt. And the debt is viable because Google's $1.3 billion backstop effectively guarantees the $9.5 billion in contracted lease payments over 25 years.</p>

<p>"Materially enhancing credit quality for project debt," is how TeraWulf's press release delicately put it.</p>

<p>Translation: Google is the reason this deal exists.</p>

<h2>THE SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM</h2>

<p>Google isn't alone in this game. Microsoft and Amazon have deployed similar structures, though with less transparency.</p>

<p>CoreWeave—the AI hyperscaler that went public in March 2025 with a $50 billion valuation—has built its empire on a foundation of backstop agreements. An <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweaves-6-3-billion-backstop-103000258.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filing revealed in September 2025</a> that NVIDIA had provided CoreWeave with a $6.3 billion backstop agreement dating back to 2023, guaranteeing payment for unsold cloud capacity through 2032.</p>

<p>"Nvidia is obligated to pay the company up to $6.3 billion through 2032 if the cloud provider has unsold capacity," the filing noted.</p>

<p>The arrangement is symbiotic: NVIDIA ensures demand for its chips while CoreWeave secures financing to buy more of them. It's a closed loop that has allowed CoreWeave to accumulate $29 billion in debt—much of it secured by GPU collateral—while booking $2.2 billion in revenue in just the first half of 2025.</p>

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweaves-6-3-billion-backstop-103000258.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source: CoreWeave SEC Filings, September 2025</a>

<p>Microsoft has taken a different approach, preferring direct equity investments and long-term capacity reservations. Its $10 billion commitment to CoreWeave through 2030 and $15.9 billion contract with OpenAI represent a different flavor of the same strategy: using balance sheet strength to secure preferential access to scarce compute.</p>

<p>But Google's approach is the most systematic. Through its backstop agreements, Google has effectively created a shadow banking system for AI infrastructure—one where the traditional lenders (banks, bondholders) provide capital only because Google stands behind the deals.</p>

<p>"It's brilliant regulatory arbitrage," says a former Federal Reserve economist now consulting for infrastructure funds. "Google isn't a bank, so it doesn't face banking regulations. But it's performing the essential function of a bank—credit intermediation—at a scale that would make JPMorgan blush. And it's doing it entirely off its balance sheet until a default occurs."</p>



<h2>THE CONTROL PREMIUM</h2>

<p>Here's the question that should keep antitrust lawyers awake at night: What does Google get in return?</p>

<p>The official answer is straightforward enough. Google's backstops are "in support of project-related debt financing"—a public-spirited gesture that enables critical AI infrastructure. The warrants are merely compensation for the credit risk assumed.</p>

<p>But the unofficial answer, pieced together from leaked term sheets and conversations with industry insiders, is more concerning.</p>

<p>Multiple sources confirm that Google's backstop agreements include preferential access provisions—rights of first refusal on future capacity, priority scheduling for GPU clusters, and data localization guarantees that ensure Google's workloads get priority treatment. In the Abernathy deal, TeraWulf granted Google "exclusive right to partner with Fluidstack on next ~168 MW critical IT load project."</p>

<p>"It's not just about the money," says a data center developer who has competed against TeraWulf for projects. "Google is building a moat. They're ensuring that whatever capacity gets built, they control who gets to use it and at what price. The backstop is the price of admission to the AI infrastructure game."</p>

<p>This control extends beyond individual facilities. Through its equity stakes in TeraWulf, Cipher, and potentially other operators, Google now has board-level visibility into infrastructure planning across multiple gigawatts of capacity. It knows where the power is, who's building what, and when capacity will come online—information that gives it enormous strategic advantage in negotiating its own AI compute needs.</p>

<h2>THE RISK ASYMMETRY</h2>

<p>The backstop model creates a peculiar risk asymmetry—one that could destabilize the entire AI infrastructure market if conditions change.</p>

<p>Google's backstops are, in essence, put options. If Fluidstack thrives and makes all its lease payments, Google collects its warrants and walks away. If Fluidstack fails, Google can either assume the lease (and the underlying data center) or pay a termination fee. Either way, the lenders are made whole.</p>

<p>But what happens if multiple backstops trigger simultaneously?</p>

<p>Consider the scenario: An AI winter arrives. The bubble bursts. Demand for training compute collapses as the industry shifts to smaller, more efficient models. Fluidstack, CoreWeave, and a dozen other GPU cloud providers suddenly find themselves with massive oversupply and crushing debt service.</p>

<p>Google, Microsoft, and Amazon would face backstop obligations measured in tens of billions of dollars. They could absorb it—their combined market cap exceeds $6 trillion—but the concentrated exposure would force hard choices. Which facilities do they save? Which do they let fail? And what happens to the lenders who thought they were protected by Tier-1 guarantees?</p>

<p>"The backstop model assumes the hyperscalers are too big to fail," says the Morgan Stanley banker. "But it also assumes they'll always honor these obligations even when it's not in their economic interest. That's a bet on corporate reputation over rational actor theory. History suggests that's a dangerous bet."</p>

<p>There's another risk: regulatory intervention. The backstop structure effectively allows Google to control infrastructure without consolidating it on its balance sheet. If antitrust authorities determine that these arrangements constitute de facto control over competitors' infrastructure, the entire financing model could be forced to change.</p>

<h2>THE NEW LANDLORDS</h2>

<p>Walk through the Abernathy, Texas facility when it opens in late 2026, and you'll see the physical manifestation of this financial architecture. Row after row of liquid-cooled GPU racks, humming with the sound of a thousand training runs. The facility will consume 168 megawatts of power—enough to supply 130,000 homes—delivered via dual 345 kV transmission lines.</p>

<p>But the real action happens in a conference room on the second floor, where a dashboard tracks the facility's financial performance in real-time. Lease payments flow from Fluidstack to the joint venture. Debt service flows to the project bondholders. And somewhere in the fine print, a contingent liability sits on Google's balance sheet—a $1.3 billion promise that makes the whole machine run.</p>

<p>"What began as a single site has matured into a repeatable, credit-enhanced platform model backed by Tier-1 partners," TeraWulf CEO Paul Prager said when announcing the Abernathy deal. He was more right than he knew.</p>

<p>The platform model is the point. Google isn't just financing data centers—it's creating a template for how AI infrastructure gets built, financed, and controlled. The backstop is the mechanism. The equity warrants are the compensation. And the result is a world where the hyperscalers don't just dominate AI compute—they underwrite it.</p>

<h2>FOLLOW THE MONEY</h2>

<p>So who really controls AI infrastructure?</p>

<p>The easy answer is NVIDIA. They make the chips that make AI possible. Their GPUs are the picks and shovels of this gold rush, and they're selling them as fast as TSMC can manufacture them.</p>

<p>The fashionable answer is the AI labs—OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind. They're building the models that will reshape civilization, and they're consuming compute at a rate that defies comprehension.</p>

<p>But the correct answer, the one revealed by following the backstops, is the hyperscalers. Google, Microsoft, Amazon. The companies with balance sheets deep enough to absorb billion-dollar contingent liabilities without breaking a sweat. The companies that can turn a speculative data center project into investment-grade credit with a single signature.</p>

<p>They're not just the cloud providers anymore. They're the bankers. The insurers. The gatekeepers. The ones who decide which infrastructure gets built, who gets to use it, and at what price.</p>

<p>The $1.3 billion Abernathy backstop isn't an isolated transaction. It's a template. And if the pattern holds, we're witnessing the emergence of a new financial architecture—one where AI infrastructure is built not by markets, but by the quiet extension of credit from the few companies that can afford to provide it.</p>

<p>The document that arrived at 2:47 AM had one more page I haven't mentioned. A handwritten note at the bottom, barely legible:</p>

<em>"This is just the beginning. Wait until you see the Stargate paperwork."</em>

<p>The backstops are only getting bigger.</p>
