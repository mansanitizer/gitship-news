<h2>How a Bitcoin miner became NVIDIA's favorite customer and the infrastructure backbone of the AI boom</h2>



<p>Brian Venturo didn't set out to build the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution. In late 2016, he was just another hedge fund guy with a side hustle and a taste for volatility. He and two buddies from Hudson Ridge Asset Management—a natural gas hedge fund in New Jersey—had been using bitcoin to settle their fantasy football bets and poker games. When crypto prices surged, the joke stopped being funny.</p>

<p>They rush-ordered GPUs from Amazon for same-day delivery and started mining bitcoin out of a garage. They called it Atlantic Crypto. Then, like most crypto origin stories, things got weird.</p>

<p>When the 2018 crypto crash hit, Venturo and co-founders Michael Intrator and Brannin McBee faced a choice. Most miners liquidated. They doubled down—buying cut-price GPUs from desperate competitors, rebranding as CoreWeave, and pivoting to cloud computing. The bet was simple: those beefy graphics chips could do something far more valuable than mining crypto—they could train machine learning models.</p>

<p>"We survived due to our hustle and our creativity," Venturo would later tell <em>Wired</em>. That hustle included buying used server cabinets off the gray market and sourcing networking gear from eBay to bypass two-year waitlists.</p>

<p>Then ChatGPT happened.</p>



<h2>The NVIDIA Courtship</h2>

<p>The launch of OpenAI's chatbot in late 2022 triggered a GPU shortage that made CoreWeave suddenly indispensable. While tech giants scrambled for NVIDIA's H100 chips, CoreWeave had inventory and the operational expertise to deploy it fast.</p>

<p>By summer 2022, CoreWeave had already spent roughly $100 million on NVIDIA's latest hardware. When the AI gold rush began, they were holding the shovels.</p>

<p>NVIDIA noticed. In April 2023, the chip giant invested $100 million in CoreWeave—a stake that would grow to approximately 6% by early 2025 and balloon to nearly $1.6 billion by May. In January 2026, NVIDIA doubled down with a $2 billion investment, cementing CoreWeave as its preferred cloud partner.</p>

<p>The relationship runs deeper than money. CoreWeave has become NVIDIA's showcase customer, consistently first to market with new architectures: first cloud provider with generally available GB200 NVL72 instances, first to deploy H200 GPUs, first with GB300 NVL72 systems in July 2025.</p>

<p>"CoreWeave's deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry," NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said in January 2026.</p>

<p>Venturo, who served as CTO from founding until March 2024 before becoming Chief Strategy Officer, put it plainly: "If I had unlimited amounts, I could have it all sold in two weeks."</p>



<h2>The $8.7 Billion Side Deal</h2>

<p>CoreWeave's most fascinating partnership isn't with NVIDIA or OpenAI—it's with a bankrupt bitcoin miner in Texas.</p>

<p>Core Scientific filed for Chapter 11 in 2022, emerged in January 2024, and appeared headed for obscurity. Then CoreWeave came knocking.</p>

<p>In June 2024, CoreWeave made an unsolicited $1 billion offer to acquire Core Scientific. The bid was rejected. But three days later, Core Scientific announced a 12-year contract to provide 200 megawatts of infrastructure for CoreWeave's high-performance computing operations.</p>

<p>By October 2024, CoreWeave had exercised options expanding the deal to approximately 500 megawatts. The total projected revenue for Core Scientific: <strong>$8.7 billion</strong> over 12 years.</p>

<p>The arrangement is audacious. Core Scientific made just $24.3 million in HPC hosting revenue in 2024, yet is now contractually committed to delivering half a gigawatt of AI infrastructure. CoreWeave is funding the conversions—estimated at $180 million—with credits against future hosting fees.</p>

<p>In July 2025, CoreWeave announced a $9 billion all-stock acquisition of Core Scientific. The deal was rejected by shareholders in October 2025. But the partnership continues, with CoreWeave renting capacity while Core Scientific scrambles to retrofit bitcoin mines into AI-ready data centers.</p>



<h2>The Man Behind the Machines</h2>

<p>Venturo's path to becoming the landlord of AI infrastructure was hardly conventional. A Haverford College economics graduate, he spent five years as a portfolio manager at Natsource Asset Management focused on energy and emissions trading, then another five as a partner at Hudson Ridge. He understood power markets and how to move fast when opportunities opened.</p>

<p>Those skills translated well to data center operations. CoreWeave's early crypto experience taught the team to optimize for efficiency and deploy hardware at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>The culture Venturo helped build is not gentle. Former employees describe grueling hours and an expectation of constant availability. Personal phone numbers are visible on company Slack profiles and can't be removed.</p>

<p>Venturo's response to the burnout problem? Weekly massages at headquarters, introduced after he recognized his own back and neck pain. "If I feel like this, other people feel like this too," he explained.</p>



<h2>The Numbers Game</h2>

<p>CoreWeave's financial trajectory reads like a venture capitalist's fever dream. Revenue grew 737% in 2024, hitting $1.92 billion. The company went public in March 2025 at a $27 billion valuation, raising $1.5 billion in the largest AI-related IPO by amount raised.</p>

<p>But the balance sheet tells a more complicated story. CoreWeave carries over $11 billion in debt, with interest expenses running at approximately $1 billion annually. The company lost $863 million in 2024 despite nearly $2 billion in revenue. Microsoft alone accounted for 62% of that revenue—the kind of customer concentration that keeps risk officers awake at night.</p>

<p>Venturo and his co-founders have already cashed out nearly $500 million through secondary sales before the IPO, while retaining 82% of voting power. It's an arrangement that gives them absolute control over a company that, by its own admission in SEC filings, has "material weaknesses" in internal financial controls.</p>



<h2>What Comes Next</h2>

<p>CoreWeave's bet is that the AI infrastructure buildout is just beginning. The company has contracted for approximately 2.2 gigawatts of power capacity and plans to build more than 5 gigawatts of "AI factories" by 2030 with NVIDIA's backing.</p>

<p>Whether that ambition pays off depends on questions nobody can answer yet. Will generative AI demand continue to justify massive capital expenditure? Can CoreWeave diversify beyond its hyperscaler dependencies? Will the Core Scientific partnership deliver, or collapse under its own audacity?</p>

<p>Venturo, for his part, sounds undeterred. "Everything that we do is about identifying and removing problems and blockers," he told <em>Wired</em>. "We push our teams to move quickly, and when things go wrong, we lift them up by solving the problems together."</p>

<p>From fantasy football bets to a $27 billion public company in eight years. From a garage full of crypto-mining rigs to the infrastructure powering ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. Brian Venturo's journey is a reminder that in technology, the most valuable real estate is often built by the people willing to hustle hardest when everyone else is heading for the exits.</p>

<p>The landlord of AI didn't plan to be here. But now that he is, he's collecting rent.</p>
