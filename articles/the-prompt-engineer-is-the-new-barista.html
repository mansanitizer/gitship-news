<em>From "hottest job in tech" to commoditized skill in 18 months—a postmortem on the shortest-lived profession of the AI era.</em>



<p>Remember when knowing how to talk to AI was a six-figure skill?</p>

<p>In 2023, Anthropic posted a job listing that went viral: "Prompt Engineer & Librarian," salary up to $335,000, based in San Francisco. The requirements? No computer science degree. No coding experience. Just "a creative hacker spirit" and a willingness to solve difficult problems. The job was essentially this: be good at chatting with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>It was, briefly, the most memeable manifestation of the AI gold rush. Here was proof that the future belonged not to the engineers who built the machines, but to the "AI whisperers" who could coax magic from them. Riley Goodside, the guy who pioneered techniques like "Chain of Thought" and "Tree of Thought" prompting, became the first-ever "Staff Prompt Engineer" at Scale AI. For a moment, it seemed like a new professional class had emerged—one where humanities majors could out-earn software engineers simply by being articulate.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later, the job is effectively dead.</p>

<p>At a closed-door meeting in early 2025, OpenAI researcher Sean Grove reportedly dropped the bomb: "Prompt engineering is dead." He wasn't being hyperbolic. A Microsoft survey of 31,000 workers across 31 countries ranked "Prompt Engineer" as the second-to-least desirable new position companies plan to add in the next 12 to 18 months. LinkedIn data shows a 40% drop in profiles bearing the title between mid-2024 and early 2025. On Indeed, searches for the role peaked at 144 per million in April 2023 and have since flatlined at 20 to 30 per million—roughly where they started before ChatGPT existed.</p>

<p>The job didn't disappear because AI failed. It disappeared because AI succeeded.</p>



<p>The arc of prompt engineering follows a pattern we've seen before, though never quite this compressed. Jared Spataro, Microsoft's Chief Marketing Officer of AI at Work, put it plainly: "Two years ago, everybody said, 'Oh, I think Prompt Engineer is going to be the hot job... [but] you don't have to have the perfect prompt anymore." The models got smarter. They started correcting your spelling mistakes, asking clarifying questions, inferring what you meant rather than taking you literally. The "correct" prompt stopped being a thing because the AI stopped needing to be handled with such delicate precision.</p>

<p>This is the cruel irony of the prompt engineer's demise: they taught the machines too well. Every carefully crafted prompt, every "system message" optimized for better outputs, every technique shared on Twitter and Reddit—these were training signals. The models learned from them. And now they don't need the teachers anymore.</p>

<p>The commoditization happened faster than anyone expected. In China, where the AI job market often presages trends in the West, junior prompt engineers now make 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per month—roughly $1,400 to $2,100 USD, or about what a decent barista earns in a major American city. The salary compression is complete. The "sexiest job in tech" has become a baseline expectation, like knowing how to use Excel or write a coherent email.</p>

<p>Sander Schulhoff, author of the world's first "Prompt Guide," insists that "prompt engineering is far from outdated. Instead, it is more important than ever." He's technically correct. The difference is that in 2023 it was "professional magic," and now it's "office common sense." The skill didn't disappear; it got democratized into irrelevance.</p>



<p>Which brings us to the baristas.</p>

<p>There's a specific type of cultural moment that produces jobs like "prompt engineer" and "specialty barista"—roles that emerge when a technology is new enough to seem mysterious but accessible enough that non-experts can participate. Both jobs relied on a kind of performative expertise: the barista who could talk about extraction times and bean origins; the prompt engineer who could discuss "temperature settings" and "token optimization." Both offered a path to white-collar respectability without traditional credentials. Both paid surprisingly well for work that looked, to the uninitiated, like something anyone could do.</p>

<p>The difference is that espresso machines don't improve themselves. They remain finicky, demanding, requiring human expertise to produce consistent results. Large language models do improve. They learn. They get better at understanding imprecise instructions, forgiving sloppy prompts, delivering acceptable results to amateurs. The barista's job was safe because the machine stayed dumb. The prompt engineer's job evaporated because the machine got smart.</p>

<p>Nationwide CTO Jim Fowler captured the transition perfectly: "Whether you're in finance, HR or legal, we see this becoming a capability within a job title, not a job title to itself." OpenAI's own academy—launched as a free learning platform—now offers tutorials that teach anyone to do what prompt engineers once charged premiums for. When the company that built the tool starts giving away the expertise for free, you know the profession is toast.</p>



<p>So what comes next?</p>

<p>The job postings offer a clue. The same companies that once sought "Prompt Engineers" now advertise for "AI Agent Designers," "Product Managers with AI Development Knowledge," or "AI Trainers" who can build complex workflows and evaluate model outputs at scale. The work hasn't disappeared—it's metastasized. What was once a discrete role has been absorbed into broader job descriptions, becoming just another bullet point in a list of required competencies.</p>

<p>This is the real pattern of AI labor disruption: not elimination but invisibility. The work still happens, but the title disappears. The "prompt engineer" becomes the marketing manager who happens to know how to use Claude. The "AI whisperer" becomes the software developer who writes prompts as part of building features. The specialized skill becomes ambient knowledge, expected of everyone, credited to no one.</p>

<p>For those who bet their careers on the title, the pivot is already underway. Wang Dan, a prompt engineer at a startup, described the role as "transitional"—a spectrum with "product managers" on one end and "technical staff" on the other. Most are drifting toward one pole or the other, trying to convert their 18 months of prompt-crafting experience into something more durable. Some are becoming AI consultants. Others are pivoting to "constraint design"—the emerging discipline of setting boundaries for AI systems rather than coaxing outputs from them.</p>

<p>The cruel lesson is that the people who benefited most from the prompt engineering boom were never the prompt engineers themselves. It was the infrastructure providers—Scale AI, which sold a 49% stake to Meta for $14.3 billion; OpenAI, which captured the value of every optimized prompt to improve its models; the consulting firms that charged clients for "AI transformation" while the actual work got cheaper and cheaper.</p>



<p>There's a particular melancholy to watching a profession die in real time. The Reddit threads where prompt engineers share their anxieties. The LinkedIn posts quietly dropping the title from bios. The job listings that still use the words but now require "1 to 3 years of industry experience + programming foundation"—the credential inflation that signals a role's transition from novelty to norm.</p>

<p>The prompt engineer was always a bet on AI's limitations. It assumed that talking to machines would remain difficult, that the gap between human intention and machine comprehension would persist long enough to build a career on. That bet was wrong. The gap closed faster than expected, and the people who had positioned themselves as bridge-builders found themselves standing on solid ground with nowhere to go.</p>

<p>So yes, the prompt engineer is the new barista—with one crucial difference. When the specialty coffee boom ended, baristas still had jobs. They just made less money and got less respect. When the prompt engineering boom ended, the job itself became unnecessary. The machines learned to understand us. And the whisperers, having taught them how, were left with nothing to whisper.</p>

<p>The future belongs not to those who know how to talk to AI, but to those who know what to ask—and what to do with the answers. The prompt was never the product. It was just the interface. And interfaces, as every technologist knows, are destined to disappear.</p>
