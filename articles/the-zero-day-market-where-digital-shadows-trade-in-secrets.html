<em>A GITSHIP NEWS Security Desk Investigation</em>



<p>The rain fell hard on the windows of the hotel bar in Geneva, blurring the city lights into streaks of gold and crimson. Across the table, a man who called himself "The Broker" slid a USB drive across the polished mahogany—a small plastic rectangle worth more than the penthouse suite upstairs.</p>

<p>"Five million," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "For a zero-click iOS chain. Fully weaponized. No user interaction required."</p>

<p>I didn't touch the drive. I didn't need to. In the zero-day market, the product isn't the code—it's the silence. The guarantee that somewhere in Cupertino, a team of engineers has no idea their fortress has a door that shouldn't exist.</p>

<p>This is the world of the zero-day vulnerability: unpatched, unknown, and worth more than blood diamonds in the right hands.</p>



<h2>The Anatomy of a Secret</h2>

<p>A zero-day vulnerability is software's original sin—a flaw that exists from the moment code compiles, invisible to its creators but potentially visible to anyone with the skill to find it. The name comes from the grim arithmetic of cybersecurity: when an exploit is discovered, the vendor has had "zero days" to fix it.</p>

<p>In 2024, Google's Threat Intelligence Group tracked 75 zero-days exploited in the wild—a decrease from 97 in 2023, but still nearly double the pre-2021 baseline [^1]. The numbers tell only part of the story. What matters isn't how many flaws exist, but who controls them.</p>

<p>"The discovery process is part art, part obsession," explains a vulnerability researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You spend months staring at assembly code, fuzzing inputs, reverse engineering binaries. Most researchers find nothing. The ones who do—they've found the keys to the kingdom."</p>

<p>Modern zero-day discovery combines ancient patience with cutting-edge automation. Researchers employ fuzzing tools like AFL++ and Google's OSS-Fuzz to bombard software with malformed data, hunting for crashes that hint at deeper vulnerabilities [^2]. Others manually audit source code, searching for the subtle logic errors that automated tools miss. The process can take months—or years.</p>

<p>But finding the bug is only the beginning. Transforming a crash into a reliable exploit requires engineering precision. "You need privilege escalation, sandbox escape, persistence mechanisms," the researcher continues. "A modern exploit chain might combine four or five separate vulnerabilities. Each one alone is worthless. Together, they're a weapon."</p>



<h2>Three Markets, One Truth</h2>

<p>The zero-day economy operates across three distinct tiers—white, gray, and black—each with its own rules, risks, and rewards.</p>

<h3>The White Market: Bug Bounties and Corporate Virtue</h3>

<p>On the legitimate end, bug bounty programs offer researchers legal pathways to monetize their discoveries. Platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd connect ethical hackers with companies willing to pay for vulnerability reports [^3]. Apple's Security Bounty program now offers up to $2 million for critical vulnerabilities, with complex exploit chains potentially earning $5 million or more [^4]. Google paid out over $10 million in bug bounties in 2024 alone [^5].</p>

<p>These programs represent cybersecurity's attempt at market economics: pay researchers more than the criminals would, and hope virtue wins. Sometimes it works.</p>

<p>"I've made more through bug bounties than I ever would have selling on the gray market," says Marcus Chen, a white-hat researcher based in Singapore. "Plus I can sleep at night. My name's in the security advisories. I'm not hiding from Interpol."</p>

<p>But the white market has limits. Corporate budgets cap payouts. Legal departments slow-walk decisions. And for the most sophisticated exploits—the kind that nation-states covet—tech companies simply can't compete with government wallets.</p>

<h3>The Gray Market: Brokers and Government Patrons</h3>

<p>This is where Zerodium and Crowdfense operate—legally registered companies that acquire zero-days from researchers and resell them to government clients [^6]. These brokers occupy a moral twilight: they don't hack anyone themselves, but they enable those who do.</p>

<p>Zerodium's price list reads like a menu at an exclusive restaurant where the currency is secrets and the diners wear uniforms:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>iOS/Android Zero-Click Full Chain</strong>: Up to $2.5 million</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp/iMessage Zero-Click</strong>: Up to $5 million</li>
<li><strong>Chrome/Safari RCE</strong>: $3–3.5 million</li>
<li><strong>Windows RCE</strong>: Up to $1 million [^7]</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, Crowdfense updated their price list to offer $5–7 million for iOS zero-days and up to $5 million for Android exploits—representing a 44% annual increase driven by improved platform security and competition with legitimate bug bounty programs [^8].</p>

<p>"The gray market exists because governments need capabilities they can't build in-house," explains a former intelligence analyst who now consults on cyber policy. "The NSA or CIA might have brilliant hackers, but they don't have the diversity of talent that the global market provides. A teenager in Eastern Europe might find something that Fort Meade missed."</p>

<p>These brokers claim to vet their customers, refusing sales to sanctioned nations or known human rights abusers. But the vetting is opaque, and the definition of "legitimate government use" varies wildly between democracies and dictatorships.</p>

<h3>The Black Market: Where Criminals Shop</h3>

<p>Beneath the gray market lies the true underworld—dark web forums where ransomware gangs, criminal syndicates, and rogue actors trade exploits for cryptocurrency. Here, prices are lower but volume is higher. A working exploit for a popular enterprise VPN might sell for $50,000. A zero-day for a widely used file transfer protocol could command $250,000 [^9].</p>

<p>Russian-speaking dark web marketplaces processed $1.4 billion in transactions during 2023—fourteen times the volume of Western dark web markets [^10]. The collapse of Hydra, the largest Russian marketplace, in 2022 only dispersed the trade to smaller platforms that proved harder to disrupt.</p>

<p>"The black market is democratizing cyber warfare," notes a Europol cybercrime investigator. "Five years ago, only nation-states had zero-days. Now any ransomware group with a few hundred thousand dollars can buy capabilities that rival advanced persistent threat groups."</p>

<p>The MOVEit Transfer breach of 2023 exemplified this convergence. The Clop ransomware gang exploited a zero-day SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) to steal data from over 2,700 organizations—a supply chain attack executed with nation-state sophistication by financially motivated criminals [^11].</p>



<h2>The Russian Gambit: Operation Zero</h2>

<p>In March 2025, a Russian company called Operation Zero made headlines by offering up to $4 million for Telegram exploits—including $1.5 million for zero-click remote code execution and $4 million for full exploit chains [^12].</p>

<p>Operation Zero isn't hiding. They maintain a public website, LinkedIn presence, and sponsor cybersecurity conferences in Moscow [^13]. They claim to operate legally under Russian jurisdiction, with "all required permits"—though they don't specify which government agencies provide oversight.</p>

<p>Their price list reveals Russia's strategic priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Android Full Chain Zero-Click</strong>: Up to $2.5 million</li>
<li><strong>iOS Full Chain Zero-Click</strong>: Up to $2 million</li>
<li><strong>Signal RCE</strong>: $1.5 million</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp Zero-Click RCE</strong>: $1.5 million</li>
<li><strong>VMware ESXi RCE</strong>: $1 million [^14]</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus on Telegram is telling. The messaging app is enormously popular in both Russia and Ukraine, making it a high-priority intelligence target. Operation Zero's public bounty suggests the Russian government has signaled demand—likely for operations against Ukrainian military and government personnel.</p>

<p>"Operation Zero represents the professionalization of state-sponsored exploit acquisition," says Winnona DeSombre Bernsen, a cybersecurity fellow at the Atlantic Council who authored a comprehensive study on the zero-day supply chain. "They're not just buying vulnerabilities; they're building a domestic capability that can compete with Western and Israeli brokers." [^15]</p>

<p>The company's CEO, Sergey Zelenyuk, is a known figure in Russian cybersecurity circles—a former vulnerability researcher who has positioned his company as the "only official Russian zero-day purchase platform." Their marketing emphasizes legality and professionalism, but their customers are Russian government and military entities.</p>



<h2>The Pegasus Legacy: When Spyware Goes Global</h2>

<p>No discussion of the zero-day market is complete without NSO Group and its Pegasus spyware—the weapon that turned iPhones into surveillance devices without their owners' knowledge.</p>

<p>Pegasus exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to achieve "zero-click" infection—meaning targets could be compromised without clicking any link or opening any attachment. In 2019, WhatsApp revealed that Pegasus had exploited a vulnerability in its app to install spyware simply by calling the target phone—even if the call wasn't answered [^16].</p>

<p>The fallout was catastrophic. In 2021, the Pegasus Project investigation revealed that 50,000 phone numbers had been selected for targeting by NSO clients, including journalists, human rights activists, opposition politicians, and government officials [^17]. Among the targets: French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and multiple U.S. State Department employees.</p>

<p>In December 2024, a U.S. court ruled that NSO Group was liable for hacking 1,400 WhatsApp users' devices, violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and California's computer fraud statutes [^18]. In May 2025, Meta was awarded $167 million in damages from NSO [^19].</p>

<p>But the legal victories haven't stopped the market. If anything, they've fragmented it. NSO's notoriety created opportunities for competitors: Intellexa, Cytrox, Paragon, and dozens of smaller vendors now offer similar capabilities [^20].</p>

<p>"The Pegasus case showed that even when a spyware vendor faces legal consequences, the demand doesn't disappear," says John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab. "Governments still want these capabilities. They just buy from different suppliers."</p>



<h2>The Nation-State Arms Race</h2>

<p>The zero-day market is ultimately driven by geopolitical competition. China, Russia, the United States, Israel, and a dozen other nations maintain active programs to acquire and stockpile zero-day vulnerabilities for offensive operations.</p>

<p>China's approach is particularly systematic. According to DeSombre Bernsen's research, China has built a domestic vulnerability pipeline that dwarfs Western capabilities—combining military recruitment, university partnerships, and hacking competitions to cultivate talent [^21]. The Tianfu Cup, China's equivalent to Pwn2Own, feeds vulnerabilities directly to the Ministry of Public Security for use in operations against Uyghurs and other targeted populations [^22].</p>

<p>"China's offensive cyber industry is already heavily integrated with AI institutions," DeSombre Bernsen notes. "They're using machine learning to accelerate vulnerability discovery while the U.S. focuses primarily on defensive applications."</p>

<p>North Korea has emerged as another major player. In 2024, North Korean actors tied with China for the highest number of attributed in-the-wild zero-day exploits—five each [^23]. Their campaigns blur espionage and financial crime, targeting both strategic intelligence and cryptocurrency assets to generate revenue for the regime.</p>

<p>The United States, meanwhile, relies on a fragmented ecosystem of defense contractors, intelligence agencies, and international partnerships. The FBI secretly purchased Pegasus spyware in 2019 and tested it for domestic surveillance before deciding against deployment [^24]. The NSA and Cyber Command acquire capabilities through classified programs whose budgets remain secret but are estimated in the billions.</p>



<h2>The Ethics of Exploitation</h2>

<p>For the researchers who find these vulnerabilities, the zero-day market presents an ethical labyrinth.</p>

<p>"I discovered a critical vulnerability in a major messaging app," says a researcher who asked to be identified only as "K." "The bug bounty offered $50,000. A gray-market broker offered $800,000. That's the difference between paying off student loans and buying a house."</p>

<p>K. chose the bug bounty. Others don't.</p>

<p>A 2024 survey by Bugcrowd found that 63% of ethical hackers have withheld security flaws at some point—suggesting that many vulnerabilities never reach responsible disclosure channels [^25]. Some researchers sell to gray-market brokers anonymously. Others develop exploits for criminal markets directly.</p>

<p>"The ethical framework is broken," argues a prominent security researcher who has testified before Congress. "We expect researchers to act against their financial interests for the greater good, while we allow brokers to operate legally and sell to governments that use these tools to target dissidents. If we want researchers to choose the white market, we need to make it competitive."</p>

<p>Apple's 2022 decision to increase bug bounty payouts to $2 million for zero-click exploits was a step in that direction [^26]. But critics argue that even these amounts can't compete with government budgets—especially when brokers can resell the same exploit to multiple clients.</p>



<h2>The Future: AI and the Democratization of Exploitation</h2>

<p>As I finished my conversation with The Broker in that Geneva hotel, he offered a final warning.</p>

<p>"The market is changing," he said, pocketing the USB drive when I declined it. "AI is coming. In five years, finding zero-days won't require genius—just compute. When anyone can generate exploits, the whole model collapses."</p>

<p>He's not wrong. Google's "Big Sleep" AI model has already demonstrated the ability to discover vulnerabilities in SQLite that human researchers missed [^27]. Other teams are training machine learning systems to automate fuzzing, reverse engineering, and exploit development.</p>

<p>The implications are profound. If AI can find zero-days at scale, the scarcity that drives the multi-million-dollar market disappears. Vulnerabilities become commodities. And the advantage shifts from those who hoard secrets to those who patch fastest.</p>

<p>"We're approaching an inflection point," says DeSombre Bernsen. "Either AI will flood the market with vulnerabilities and force a fundamental restructuring of software security, or the most sophisticated exploits will remain the province of human researchers—with AI simply accelerating the arms race between attackers and defenders."</p>



<h2>Epilogue: The Hotel Room</h2>

<p>I left The Broker in the bar and walked through Geneva's rain-slicked streets. Somewhere in the city, delegates from the Pall Mall Process—a UK-France initiative to regulate the commercial spyware market—were meeting to discuss export controls and human rights safeguards [^28].</p>

<p>Their efforts are laudable. They're also likely futile.</p>

<p>The zero-day market exists because software has bugs, governments want advantages, and researchers need to eat. These facts are immutable. Regulation might shift the market's geography—pushing brokers from Dubai to Tbilisi, from Tel Aviv to Singapore—but it won't eliminate the trade.</p>

<p>In my hotel room, I checked my phone. A news alert: another zero-day in a popular VPN product, actively exploited by a Chinese APT group. CISA had added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. Patches were available, but the exploitation had begun weeks ago.</p>

<p>The zero-day market never sleeps. While diplomats debate ethics, while researchers weigh offers, while brokers negotiate commissions—the vulnerabilities wait. Silent. Valuable. Ready to become weapons.</p>

<p>In the zero-day economy, secrets are currency. And business is booming.</p>
