<strong>By GITSHIP NEWS Tech Desk</strong> | February 17, 2026



<p>In October 2025, a researcher at Samsung SAIL Montreal published a paper that quietly upended one of AI's most entrenched assumptions. Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau's "Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks" introduced the Tiny Recursive Model (TRM)—a neural network with just 7 million parameters that outperforms models 100,000 times its size on complex reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p>The implications extend far beyond academic curiosity. In an era where AI development increasingly concentrates in the hands of corporations with billion-dollar compute budgets, TRM demonstrates that algorithmic innovation can still trump brute-force scaling—and that the path to artificial general intelligence may not require ever-larger data centers.</p>

<h2>The Paper and Its Origins</h2>

<strong>Title:</strong> "Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks"  
<strong>Author:</strong> Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau  
<strong>Institution:</strong> Samsung AI Lab (SAIL) Montreal  
<strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 6, 2025  
<strong>arXiv ID:</strong> 2510.04871  
<strong>Code Repository:</strong> https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels

<p>The paper emerged from efforts to simplify the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), published earlier in 2025 by researchers at Sapient Intelligence. HRM achieved impressive results using two interdependent neural networks operating at different "frequencies"—a design inspired by neuroscience theories about hierarchical brain processing. While effective, Jolicoeur-Martineau found the architecture "too complicated, relying too much on biological arguments about the human brain."</p>

<p>TRM strips away the biological justifications and architectural complexity, achieving superior performance through a more elegant recursive mechanism. The result is a model that uses 74% fewer parameters than HRM while delivering dramatically better results.</p>

<h2>What "Recursive" Actually Means</h2>

<p>The term "recursive" in TRM refers to a fundamentally different approach to neural computation. Rather than processing input through a deep stack of unique layers—a 32-layer transformer, for instance—TRM applies the same small network repeatedly through an iterative refinement loop.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<p>The model maintains two latent state variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>z (latent reasoning state):</strong> A "scratchpad" where the model performs intermediate computations</li>
<li><strong>y (current prediction):</strong> The model's evolving answer hypothesis</li>
</ul>
<p>At each iteration, TRM performs multiple latent updates (typically 6) to refine its reasoning state, followed by one answer update. This cycle repeats for multiple supervision steps (up to 16 during training), with the model learning to minimize error at each stage through a technique called "deep supervision."</p>

<p>The mathematical formulation is elegant in its simplicity:</p>

<pre><code>z_new = network(x, y, z_old)  [iterated 6 times]
<p>y_new = network(y_old, z_new) [final output update]</p>
</code></pre>

<p>Crucially, the same network weights process every refinement step. This weight reuse creates what the paper calls "effective depth"—the equivalent of 42 transformer layers (21 passes × 2 physical layers)—without the parameter count or memory requirements of an actual 42-layer network.</p>

<p>"The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to solve hard tasks is a trap," Jolicoeur-Martineau writes. TRM offers an alternative path.</p>

<h2>The Benchmark Results: Numbers That Demand Attention</h2>

<p>TRM's performance on established reasoning benchmarks challenges conventional wisdom about model scaling:</p>

<h3>Sudoku-Extreme</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRM-MLP (5M parameters):</strong> 87.4% accuracy</li>
<li><strong>HRM (27M parameters):</strong> 55.0% accuracy</li>
<li><strong>DeepSeek R1 (671B parameters):</strong> 0.0% accuracy</li>
<li><strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet:</strong> 0.0% accuracy</li>
<li><strong>o3-mini-high:</strong> 0.0% accuracy</li>
</ul>
<p>The margin is staggering. A model with less than 0.001% of DeepSeek R1's parameters solves professional-difficulty Sudoku puzzles at near-human levels while the massive language models fail completely.</p>

<h3>ARC-AGI-1 (Abstract Reasoning Corpus)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRM-Att (7M parameters):</strong> 44.6% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>HRM:</strong> 40.3% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>Grok 4 (with thinking):</strong> 66.7% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro:</strong> 37.0% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking):</strong> 28.6% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>o3-mini-high:</strong> 34.5% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>DeepSeek R1:</strong> 15.8% pass@2</li>
</ul>
<p>ARC-AGI is specifically designed to test fluid intelligence—the ability to recognize patterns and apply rules to novel problems. Human performance on ARC-AGI-1 is approximately 85%, meaning TRM achieves roughly half human-level performance with 7 million parameters.</p>

<h3>ARC-AGI-2 (Harder Variant)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRM:</strong> 7.8% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>HRM:</strong> 5.0% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>Grok 4 (thinking):</strong> 16.0% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro:</strong> 4.9% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>o3-mini-high:</strong> 3.0% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>DeepSeek R1:</strong> 1.3% pass@2</li>
<li><strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet:</strong> 0.7% pass@2</li>
</ul>
<p>The ARC-AGI-2 benchmark was designed to be significantly more challenging than its predecessor, with humans still able to solve most tasks while AI systems struggle. TRM's 7.8% represents a meaningful advancement over other small models, though frontier models like Grok 4 with extensive test-time compute still lead.</p>

<h3>Maze-Hard (30×30 grids)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRM-Att:</strong> 85.3% accuracy</li>
<li><strong>HRM:</strong> 74.5% accuracy</li>
<li><strong>All tested LLMs:</strong> 0.0% accuracy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why LLMs Fail Where TRM Succeeds</h2>

<p>The performance gap between TRM and large language models on these tasks reveals fundamental architectural limitations of the transformer paradigm.</p>

<p>Large language models generate outputs autoregressively—one token at a time, with no ability to revise earlier decisions. For a Sudoku puzzle, this means predicting all 81 cells in sequence. One incorrect prediction early in the sequence cascades through the entire solution, rendering it invalid.</p>

<p>"LLMs generate answers autoregressively, predicting one token at a time. For tasks like solving a Sudoku puzzle, this is incredibly fragile," explains a technical analysis of the paper. "A single incorrect number can invalidate the entire solution. We're forcing a model designed for linguistic fluency to adhere to strict, symbolic logic it wasn't built for."</p>

<p>TRM, by contrast, iteratively refines complete solutions. It can detect inconsistencies, backtrack, and correct mistakes across multiple reasoning cycles—much like a human solving a puzzle. The latent state z serves as working memory, allowing the model to maintain and update its reasoning context throughout the iterative process.</p>

<h2>Implications for the "Bigger Is Better" Paradigm</h2>

<p>TRM's success challenges the scaling hypothesis that has dominated AI research since the GPT-3 era. That hypothesis, supported by papers like "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (Kaplan et al., 2020), suggested that model performance predictably improves with increased parameters, data, and compute.</p>

<p>The TRM results suggest a more nuanced picture:</p>

<strong>1. Architecture matters as much as scale</strong>

<p>TRM achieves 87.4% on Sudoku-Extreme with 5 million parameters, while models with 100,000× more parameters score 0%. The difference isn't data—it's architectural fit to the problem domain.</p>

<strong>2. Recursion can substitute for depth</strong>

<p>Traditional transformers achieve representational capacity through physical depth—stacking more layers. TRM achieves similar capacity through temporal depth—iterating the same layers multiple times. This trade-off between space (parameters) and time (iterations) opens new optimization dimensions.</p>

<strong>3. Task-specific efficiency beats general-purpose brute force</strong>

<p>TRM is not a general-purpose model. It cannot generate creative text, engage in open-ended conversation, or leverage broad world knowledge. But for structured reasoning tasks with well-defined solutions, its specialized design dramatically outperforms generalist approaches.</p>

<p>As researcher Sebastian Raschka notes in his analysis: "These recursive architectures are exciting proof-of-concepts that highlight how small, efficient models can 'reason' through iterative self-refinement."</p>

<h2>The Edge AI Revolution</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most significant implications of TRM concern accessibility and deployment. The model's efficiency profile enables applications that would be impossible with large language models:</p>

<strong>Training costs:</strong> Under $500 total—approximately 36 GPU-hours on consumer-grade hardware (4× H100s for 2 days). This compares to millions of dollars for training frontier LLMs.

<strong>Inference requirements:</strong> ~200MB RAM, enabling deployment on smartphones, embedded systems, and edge devices without cloud connectivity.

<strong>Energy consumption:</strong> Orders of magnitude lower than billion-parameter models, making sustainable AI deployment feasible.

<strong>Accessibility:</strong> The MIT-licensed open-source release enables researchers, startups, and hobbyists to experiment with state-of-the-art reasoning without massive infrastructure.

<p>For applications like logistics optimization, system diagnostics, resource allocation, and quality control—domains requiring structured reasoning on constrained hardware—TRM represents a practical path forward.</p>

<h2>Critical Perspectives and Limitations</h2>

<p>The TRM story is not without caveats. A follow-up analysis by researchers at Western University and Varonova Tech (arXiv:2512.11847, December 2025) examined the ARC Prize verification checkpoint and identified important nuances:</p>

<strong>Test-time compute matters significantly:</strong> The 1000-sample augmentation and majority-vote pipeline contributes approximately 11 percentage points to TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance. Single-pass accuracy is lower than the headline numbers suggest.

<strong>Puzzle identity dependence:</strong> The checkpoint shows strict dependence on task identifiers—replacing correct puzzle IDs with random tokens reduces accuracy to zero. This suggests the model relies heavily on task-specific conditioning rather than pure generalization from input patterns.

<strong>Shallow effective recursion:</strong> Most accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step, with diminishing returns from subsequent iterations. The "deep" reasoning may be shallower than the architecture suggests.

<p>These findings don't invalidate TRM's achievements, but they contextualize them. The model represents a sophisticated interaction between architecture, training methodology (heavy augmentation), and test-time compute—not pure architectural superiority.</p>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>TRM opens several promising research directions:</p>

<strong>Hybrid architectures:</strong> Combining recursive reasoning modules with large language models could yield systems that leverage both broad knowledge and structured reasoning. TRM-like components could serve as specialized "calculators" for LLM tool-use scenarios.

<strong>Extended domains:</strong> The principles of iterative refinement may apply beyond grid-based puzzles to code generation, mathematical proof, scientific discovery, and other structured reasoning tasks.

<strong>Theoretical foundations:</strong> Key questions remain unanswered. Why does recursion outperform physical depth for small datasets? What are the scaling laws relating recursion depth, network size, and data requirements?

<strong>Hardware optimization:</strong> The predictable, iterative computation pattern of TRM may enable specialized hardware acceleration, further widening the efficiency gap with large models.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Tiny Recursive Model represents more than an incremental improvement in benchmark scores. It demonstrates that the path to artificial intelligence need not be a monotonic march toward ever-larger models consuming ever-greater resources.</p>

<p>In an industry increasingly dominated by a handful of corporations with the capital to train trillion-parameter models, TRM offers a different vision: sophisticated AI capabilities accessible to researchers with modest budgets, deployable on consumer hardware, and efficient enough to run sustainably at global scale.</p>

<p>The "bigger is better" paradigm isn't dead—frontier models still achieve remarkable general-purpose capabilities that TRM cannot match. But TRM proves that bigger isn't the only path. For structured reasoning tasks, algorithmic elegance can still triumph over brute-force scaling.</p>

<p>As the AI community grapples with questions of concentration, accessibility, and environmental impact, the lesson of TRM is clear: innovation in architecture and training methodology can unlock capabilities that raw scale cannot—and sometimes, less truly is more.</p>
