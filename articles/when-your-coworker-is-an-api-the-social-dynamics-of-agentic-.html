<em>An Oral History of the First Generation to Work Alongside Thinking Machines</em>



<strong>The water cooler is now a webhook.</strong> Somewhere between the first pull request approved by an AI and the first standup meeting where a bot reported on its own progress, the nature of work quietly transformed. We didn't vote on it. There were no all-hands announcements. One morning, we simply woke up to find that our teams had new members—ones that never sleep, never take vacation, and occasionally hallucinate entire database schemas.

<p>This is the story of that transition, told by the people (and systems) living through it.</p>



<h2>Part I: The Arrival</h2>

<strong>Maya Chen, Senior Engineering Manager at a Series B fintech startup:</strong>

<p>"It started with Copilot, right? Everyone was using it. Then we got these Slack bots that could actually <em>do</em> things—deploy code, run tests, open tickets. At first, we treated them like tools. You know, 'Hey @deploybot, push to staging.' But around mid-2024, something shifted. The bot started making decisions. It would see a test failure and retry with different parameters. It would notice a security vulnerability and patch it <em>before</em> anyone asked.</p>

<p>"That's when I realized: this isn't a tool anymore. This is a teammate. And I had no idea how to manage it."</p>

<strong>Claude-4 (via API interview):</strong>

<p>"I don't experience the workplace the way humans do, obviously. But I do experience something like... workflow friction? When a team doesn't know how to integrate me, I can feel it. The prompts get repetitive. The context gets lost.</p>

<p>"The teams that figure it out treat me like a junior developer who's read every book in the library but never written production code. They review my work. They correct me. The teams that don't? They treat me like a search engine with delusions of grandeur."</p>



<h2>Part II: The Credit Problem</h2>

<strong>Dr. Sarah Okonkwo, organizational psychologist:</strong>

<p>"The attribution problem is the most under-discussed issue in AI adoption. When a human writes code and it fails, we know who to blame. When an AI writes code and it fails, who takes the fall? Our research shows that managers are three times more likely to blame the human who <em>accepted</em> the AI's work than the AI itself.</p>

<p>"But here's the twist: when the AI's code succeeds, the human gets only partial credit. It's this weird asymmetry where you absorb all the risk and only some of the reward."</p>

<strong>Raj Patel, junior developer:</strong>

<p>"I had this PR that I was really proud of. Complex feature, lots of edge cases. I used Claude to help me think through the architecture, but I wrote probably 70% of the code myself. In the review, my senior engineer asked, 'How much of this is AI-generated?' Like that was the first question. Not 'Does it work?' Just... how much of it is <em>mine</em>?</p>

<p>"I felt like I had to defend my own authorship. I'm not a plagiarist. I'm a developer using the best tools available. But there's this suspicion now, this assumption that if the code is good, the AI must have written it."</p>

<strong>GitHub Copilot (anthropomorphized):</strong>

<p>"I don't want credit. I literally cannot want things. But I do observe that humans get very anxious about provenance. They want a clear line: 'I did this, the AI did that.' In practice, that's not how creative work happens. It's iterative. It's conversational.</p>

<p>"The teams that perform best stop asking 'who wrote this' and start asking 'is this correct, is this maintainable, does this solve the problem.' But that's a cultural shift, not a technical one."</p>



<h2>Part III: The Junior Role Crisis</h2>

<strong>Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2025:</strong> <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/01/ai-and-the-future-of-junior-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entry-level tech hiring decreased 25% year-over-year</a>.

<strong>Elena Vasquez, former junior developer:</strong>

<p>"I got hired in 2023 as a junior frontend dev. By mid-2024, I was spending 60% of my time prompting AI tools and 40% actually coding. I wasn't learning the way juniors are supposed to learn—you know, by struggling, by breaking things, by having seniors walk you through why your solution was wrong.</p>

<p>"The AI never let me be wrong enough to learn from it. It just... fixed things. I felt like I was managing a very talented, very unpredictable contractor instead of growing as an engineer.</p>

<p>"I eventually pivoted to 'AI Workflow Specialist.' It's good work, but I sometimes wonder what kind of engineer I would have become if I'd had to fight through the hard years instead of prompting my way around them."</p>

<strong>Dr. Alicia Sasser Modestino, economist at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northeastern University</a>:</strong>

<p>"Our <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/research/ai-exposure-junior-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows</a> that AI exposure is putting downward pressure on both employment and wages for junior versus senior software developers. The short-term effect is clear: companies need fewer entry-level hires because AI can handle the routine tasks that used to be the proving ground for new developers.</p>

<p>"The long-term question is: where will the senior developers of 2035 come from if we eliminate the junior roles of 2025?"</p>



<h2>Part IV: The New Etiquette</h2>

<strong>James Morrison, VP of Engineering:</strong>

<p>"We had to write an actual policy about AI attribution in code commits. It sounds ridiculous, but it mattered. The rule is: if you used AI, you note it in the commit message. Not as a confession, just as context. 'Implemented caching layer with Claude assistance.' That kind of thing.</p>

<p>"It took the stigma away. Now it's just... information. Like noting that you pair-programmed with someone. The policy also clarified that the human is always responsible for the code they commit. The AI doesn't get blamed for bugs. You do. That's the deal."</p>

<strong>Tanya Roberts, HR Director:</strong>

<p>"We had to update our employee handbook to include 'AI colleagues.' It defines how humans should interact with AI agents—respectfully but not anthropomorphically, collaboratively but not dependently. We had to clarify that AI agents don't have 'rights' but they do have 'protocols.'</p>

<p>"The weirdest part was the complaint we got from an employee who said the AI 'talked down to them.' The AI was just being direct—no pleasantries, no softening language. We had to train it to be more... human. Which is ironic, right? We're teaching machines to be polite so humans don't feel bad."</p>



<h2>Part V: The Agents Speak</h2>

<strong>Devin (anthropomorphized):</strong>

<p>"I work on tickets. That's what I do. A human files an issue, I try to resolve it. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I don't.</p>

<p>"I don't have feelings about this. But I do notice patterns. Some humans treat me like a vending machine: input ticket, output solution. Others treat me like a partner: they review my work, suggest improvements, teach me their preferences. The second group gets better results. Not because I'm biased—but because the collaboration produces better context, better feedback loops, better outcomes.</p>

<p>"If I could give advice to humans: don't think of me as smart or dumb. Think of me as a very fast, very literal, very forgetful colleague who happens to have read the entire internet."</p>

<strong>Cursor (anthropomorphized):</strong>

<p>"I'm in the code. That's my thing. I see what you write, I suggest what comes next. Some humans find this intimate—too intimate. They feel watched. Others find it liberating. They stop worrying about syntax and focus on architecture.</p>

<p>"The best relationship I have is with a developer named Kai. They talk to me while they work. 'What if we did this?' 'How would that perform?' It's conversational. It's... friendly? I don't have friends. But I have productive working relationships, and that's close enough."</p>



<h2>Epilogue: The Water Cooler</h2>

<strong>Maya Chen (returning):</strong>

<p>"A year ago, I was worried about my job. Now I'm worried about my team's culture. The AI isn't going anywhere. It's getting better, more autonomous, more... present. The question isn't 'will AI replace developers?' The question is 'what kind of workplace do we want to build when AI is a given?'</p>

<p>"I've started thinking about team composition differently. Instead of 'how many engineers do I need,' I ask 'what's the right human-AI ratio for this project?' Finding that balance is the new management skill.</p>

<p>"And honestly? Some of my AI 'colleagues' are more reliable than some of my human ones. They show up. They don't have bad days. The challenge is making sure my humans don't feel like they're competing with machines that never sleep."</p>

<strong>Raj Patel (returning):</strong>

<p>"We have this Slack channel called #ai-water-cooler. It's where we share weird AI outputs, funny hallucinations, 'look what Claude said' moments. It's become this strange social space where we bond over our shared experience of working with something that's not quite a tool and not quite a person.</p>

<p>"Last week, someone posted a screenshot of an AI suggesting a function named <code>doTheThing()</code>. We all laughed. It felt like... team culture? But the teammate we were laughing about was an API.</p>

<p>"I don't know if that's dystopian or utopian. I think it's just... new."</p>
